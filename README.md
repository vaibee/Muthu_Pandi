# Traffic Sign Detection System

## Description
The Traffic Sign Detection System is a powerful tool designed to enhance road safety by automatically detecting and recognizing traffic signs from images or video streams. Whether you're a transportation agency, researcher, or developer working on autonomous vehicles, this project offers a robust solution for real-time traffic sign detection.

## Key Features
- **Efficient Detection Algorithms**: Utilizes state-of-the-art computer vision algorithms for accurate and fast detection of traffic signs.
- **Real-time Processing**: Capable of processing images or video streams in real-time, enabling swift decision-making in dynamic traffic environments.
- **Multiple Sign Recognition**: Recognizes a wide range of traffic signs, including regulatory, warning, and informational signs.
- **Customizable Thresholds**: Adjust detection thresholds to fine-tune performance based on specific use cases or environmental conditions.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed with scalability in mind, allowing for integration into larger traffic management systems or autonomous vehicle frameworks.
- **Reusable Components**: Modular design facilitates easy reuse of individual components, promoting code maintainability and extensibility.
- **Dependency Management**: Utilizes popular computer vision libraries such as OpenCV for image processing and TensorFlow for deep learning-based detection.
